# Defining types for `HoneyRaesAPI`
In this chapter we will use classes to define the application-specific types for HoneyRaesAPI, and learn how to use namespaces to better organize our code. 

## Data Models and Namespaces

For the rest of the course starting with this chapter, we are going to keep all of the data type files we create in a folder called `Models`. Go ahead and create that folder in VS Code or the terminal. It should be in the same directory as `Program.cs` and the `csproj` file. 

### Namespaces

Namespaces are another concept in C# that you didn't learn about in your introduction to programming in the front end part of the course. A `namespace`, most simply stated, is a space for names. Names are things like class definition names. Within a `namespace`, those names have to be unique (for example, you can't have two classes both named `AwesomeClass` within the same namespace). If you are familiar with the concept of _scope_ from Javascript, a namespace creates a scope for classes, even across multiple files if those files use the same namespace. 

In Javascript, you got used to different files creating different _modules_ that you could import from one to another. But a C# project is different. Once the code is compiled, the different files you wrote are no longer relevant - there is just one file of compiled code per project that .NET runs. In Book 1, because we didn't use namespaces, all of the code in all of the files of our project was in one global namespace. 

You can see how class names are recognized across files in your program like this: 

1. Open `ThrownForALoop` in VS Code
1. At the bottom of `Program.cs`, add this line: `class Product {}`
1. You should see a compiler error that says `The namespace '<global namespace>' already contains a definition for 'Product' [ThrownForALoop]`. 
1. See? The compiler doesn't see `Product.cs` as a different "module" than what's in `Program.cs`. 
1. You can remove the extra code and close `ThrownForALoop`

### Namespace for our Models

1. In the Models folder, create three files: `Customer.cs`, `Employee.cs`, and `ServiceTicket.cs`
1. At the top of each file, add this line `namespace HoneyRaesAPI.Models;`
1. In each file create a `public` `class` that matches the file names underneath the namespace declaration. 
1. Now, to illustrate how this is different from having the files all in the global namespace, go back to `Program.cs`. Add the line `class Customer { }` to the very bottom of the file, underneath the `WeatherForecast` record. See? there is no compiler error because the two `Customer` classes are in different _namespaces_ now. You can remove this last line of code, it was for demonstration only. 

Why `HoneyRaesAPI.Models`? While this isn't enforced by the language, it is very common to have namespaces be nested the same way that the folder structure of the project is nested. Think of `HoneyRaesAPI` as the top-level namespace for the project. Because `Models` is a folder nested inside the project, we give it its own _nested_ namespace, and put all of the classes declared inside it in that namespace. Later in the course we will be adding more nested namespaces to our projects as they get bigger. 

From now on for this course, you won't declare any classes inside `Program.cs`, so you don't need to give it a namespace, it can stay in the global namespace.

This intro is just getting you started with namespaces, there is a lot more to learn. See the extra material below, but don't get hung up on it right now. 

### Finish the type definitions for our data models

Add the appropriate properties for the data models:
1. `Customer` should have `Id`, `Name` and `Address` properties
1. `Employee` should have `Id`, `Name`, and `Specialty` properties
1. `ServiceTicket` should have `Id`, `CustomerId`, `EmployeeId`, `Description`, `Emergency` (this is a boolean), and `DateCompleted` properties.

## üîç Additional Materials
1. [namespace keyword](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/namespace)
    - Note in this documentation, some namespaces are declared with a pair of `{}`, and the classes in that namespace are inside the curly braces. In older code this was the only way that you could create namespaces. 
    - C# recently added the ability to declare a "file scoped namespace declaration". This is what we did in HoneyRaesAPI, and is handy because it removes a level of curly brace nesting on the left-hand side of the code files. It puts all of the types declared in a file in that namespace, which is what we want!
