# ðŸš™ðŸš— Car Builder Setup
The main goal of this project is to help you think about how the APIs you are going to build from this point in the course forward fit into a larger full-stack application architecture. This column assumes you have completed the front-end Car Builder project.

## Project Setup
1. Use the [instructions](./web-api-setup.md) from the first column to create a webapi called `CarBuilder` in your csharp directory. 
1. Add a `Models` folder, and create the classes required for CarBuilder with their properties:
    - `PaintColor`
        - `Id`
        - `Price`
        - `Color`
    - `Interior`
        - `Id`
        - `Price`
        - `Material`
    - `Technology`
        - `Id`
        - `Price`
        - `Package`
    - `Wheels`
        - `Id`
        - `Price`
        - `Style`
    - `Order`
        - `Id`
        - `Timestamp`
        - `WheelId`
        - `TechnologyId`
        - `PaintId`
        - `InteriorId`
1. Create a DTOs folder inside the Models folder, and add DTOs for each of the models. They can have identical properties as their corresponding Model classes for now. 
1. Delete the weather-forecast related code.  
1. Create collections at the top of `Program.cs` as the database for this project. Make sure that you have populated those collections with the data they need (you can leave the orders collection empty). If you don't want to make up your own options data, you can use these:
