# Book 4 - Building More Complex APIs with Controllers
This book focuses on creating web APIs using a broader range of tools and technologies that are available in ASP.NET. As applications grow, the Minimal APIs syntax we have been using up until now becomes limiting. There is no coding assessment for this book - the capstone project serves as the final assessment for this book and the entire course. 

## Learning Objectives
1. Organizing endpoints with Controllers
    - Dependency Injection with Constructors and Fields
    - Routing with Attributes
