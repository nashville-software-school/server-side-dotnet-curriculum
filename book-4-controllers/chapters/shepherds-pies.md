# :pizza: Shepherd's Pies
Giuseppe Shepherd learned how to make the perfect pizza as a child from his nonna. Since then it's been his dream to open his own restaurant, but he needs help creating the order management system for his new business.



## Project Description
Giuseppe's (Joe, to his friends) restaurant has a dining room and delivery service available.

### Orders
Each order at the restaurant can have multiple pizzas on it. Eventually, there will be other items available, for the restaurant opening Joe is going to only serve pizzas. Each pizza on an order can have a cheese type, a sauce type, and then any number of toppings chosen from a list on the menu.
