# Get all overdue checkouts
The librarians want to see all overdue checkouts so that they can send emails to the patrons that need to return the books. Create an endpoint that does this.
- Create a calculated property on the `Checkout` class that is a boolean called `Overdue`. Use the `MaterialType`'s `CheckoutDays` property and the `Checkout`'s `CheckoutDate` and `DateTime.Now` to determine whether `Overdue` should be `true` or `false`. Assume that materials that have been returned are not overdue, regardless of their return date. 
- Get checkouts and include the material, then include the material type (the `Overdue` property needs all that data to return the right value). Include the `Patron` data as well, so that the librarian knows who to email.
- use `Where` to filter out the non-overdue checkouts.
