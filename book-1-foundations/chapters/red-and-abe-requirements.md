# Reductio & Absurdum :mage: :magic_wand:

Reductio & Absurdum have been providing high-quality magical supplies to the wizarding community for nearly 1000 years at their shop on Calendula Road. Red has been insisting on modernizing for years, and Abe has finally agreed to start digitizing their records.

## Basic Project Requirements

1. You will build a new .NET console app.
1. Create a main menu with working options to view all products, add a product to the inventory, delete a product from the inventory, and update a product's details
1. Products have a name, price (as a decimal), and a boolean to indicate whether they are still available. They also have a ProductTypeId, which categorize them into the following categories: apparel, potions, enchanted objects, and wands. When adding a product to the inventory, the user should be able to choose from these options to add a product type id to the new product.
1. Product Types have Name and Id properties.
1. Red and Abe should be able to look up products in their database by product type.

After completing these requirements, there are further chapters with extra requirements to fulfill.
